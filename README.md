## About ü§î

Pogy is a Discord bot that was created exactly 2 years ago. The initial code was broken, prompting us to fix the bugs and transform it into a multipurpose discord.js v13 bot! You can click [this link](https://394wkx-3000.csb.app//invite) to invite the official bot! Additionally, you can join the official [Pogy's Support Server](https://394wkx-3000.csb.app//support) for assistance.

**The callbacks in Discord's dev portal:**
This will have 2 parts, callback for the main client ID, and the other for the auth client ID. I did this so that the main client doesn't get ratelimited. You can use the same Id for main_client_id and auth_client_id and put the 3 callbacks in the same application.

MAIN CLIENT ID:
- yourdomain/thanks example [https://394wkx-3000.csb.app//thanks](https://394wkx-3000.csb.app//thanks) or [http://localhost:3000/thanks](http://localhost:3000/thanks)
- yourdomain/window example [https://394wkx-3000.csb.app//window](https://394wkx-3000.csb.app//window) or [http://localhost:3000/window](http://localhost:3000/window)

AUTH CLIENT ID:
- yourdomain/callback example [https://394wkx-3000.csb.app//callback](https://394wkx-3000.csb.app//callback) or [http://localhost:3000/callback](http://localhost:3000/callback)

**TOP.gg:**
To add top.gg to your site, add `DBL_AUTH` as your dbl api key to the `.env` file. And `yourdomain/dblwebhook` as a webhook url on top.gg's site settings. Example: `https://yourbot.com/dblwebhook

**Replit:**
To run on replit you must install node js `v.16.9.1` to do so go to bash (the bash terminal on your repl) and paste: `npm init -y && npm i --save-dev node@16.9.0 && npm config set prefix=$(pwd)/node_modules/node && export PATH=$(pwd)/node_modules/node/bin:$PATH`

Make sure you have enabled `Privileged Intents` on your Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). You can find these intents under the "Bot" section, and there are two ticks you have to switch on. For more information on Gateway Intents, check out [this](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html#the-intents-bit-field-wrapper) link.

You can launch the bot with `npm start`

**Important Note:** Before you join the support server for help, read the guide carefully.
